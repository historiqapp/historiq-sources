            "content": "Voltaire was the Enlightenment's most famous wit and a fierce defender of freedom of speech and religious tolerance. He used satire to attack the intolerance of the French monarchy and the Catholic Church. His exile in England inspired him to champion the English system of constitutional monarchy and civil liberties, which would eventually influence the American and French Revolutions.",

            "content": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke debated the relationship between individuals and their government. Locke argued that people have 'natural rights' to life, liberty, and property, and that governments exist solely to protect these rights. Rousseau introduced the 'Social Contract', suggesting that true authority comes from the 'general will' of the people. These ideas formed the bedrock of modern democratic theory.",
